Linear-Gradient: I thought the background color of the whole document being in a gradient color format would be cool but was unsure how to do it. Here is the link I followed to get the results I was looking for. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient/linear-gradient

Instructions: Load into page, click 'start game' button. Match all cards in 1 minute to display YOU WIN! If you fail to match all cards, game displays YOU LOSE.

Next Steps:

- [x] Create animation for cards to look like they are being flipped (using tranlate transform)
- [x] Add a scoreboard so you can play multiple times
- [x] Have it to where cards get shuffled in random order each time new game is started
